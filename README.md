# GAN for Generating MNIST Digits

This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate handwritten digit images similar to those in the **MNIST** dataset. The GAN consists of two networks:
1. **Generator**: Tries to create fake images that look real.
2. **Discriminator**: Tries to distinguish real images from fake ones.

These two networks compete against each other, and through training, the Generator learns to create more realistic images.

## Project Overview

### 1. **Initial Setup**
At the beginning of the program, we define some configurations:
- **Latent Vector Size (`latent_dim`)**: This is the "random noise" input to the Generator to create images.
- **Batch Size (`batch_size`)**: How many images are processed at each training step.
- **Learning Rate (`lr`)**: The rate at which the weights of the networks are adjusted.
- **Epochs (`epochs`)**: The number of times the program will see the entire dataset.

### 2. **Loading the Dataset**
The `dataset.py` file uses PyTorch to download and load the MNIST dataset:
- MNIST contains images of handwritten digits (0-9) in grayscale (28x28 pixels).
- The images are normalized to values between -1 and 1, which helps the GAN training process.

### 3. **Generator and Discriminator Architectures**
- **Generator**:
  - Takes a random vector (`latent_dim`) as input.
  - Passes this vector through linear layers, increasing the dimension at each stage.
  - Finally, it produces a 28x28 pixel image.
  - Uses activation functions like **ReLU** and **Tanh** to adjust values.

- **Discriminator**:
  - Takes an image (28x28 pixels) as input.
  - Flattens the image into a vector (784 values).
  - Passes it through linear layers to decide whether the image is real or fake.
  - Uses **LeakyReLU** for smooth gradients and **Sigmoid** to produce a probability between 0 and 1.

### 4. **Training**
The training process alternates between two objectives:
1. **Training the Discriminator**:
   - It receives real images from the dataset and fake images generated by the Generator.
   - It learns to assign a value of 1 for real images and 0 for fake ones.
   - The weights are updated using the **BCE Loss** (Binary Cross Entropy).

2. **Training the Generator**:
   - It generates fake images that are evaluated by the Discriminator.
   - The goal of the Generator is to deceive the Discriminator into thinking its fake images are real.
   - The weights are updated to improve the Generatorâ€™s ability to produce realistic images.

This process repeats for each batch of images and for multiple epochs.

### 5. **Visualizing Results**
Every 10 epochs, the program:
- Generates new images using the Generator.
- Displays these images in the terminal so you can monitor the progress.

At the start, the generated images are just "noise". Over time, they become more like real digits.

## How It Works

1. The program loads the MNIST dataset.
2. Initializes the Generator and the Discriminator.
3. Alternates between:
   - Training the Discriminator to differentiate real from fake images.
   - Training the Generator to create more realistic fake images.
4. Displays the generated images periodically.

## Why Is This Interesting?
- **GANs** are widely used for modern tasks such as:
  - Generating realistic images (e.g., StyleGAN).
  - Image style transfer (e.g., turning photos into "paintings").
  - Creating realistic fake human faces.
- This project serves as a practical introduction to these techniques.
